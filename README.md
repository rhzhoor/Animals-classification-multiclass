Welcome to my GitHub repository where I have shared my project on multiclass classification for animals using SVM linear. This project involves the use of machine learning algorithms to classify animals into different categories based on their features.

Through this project, I have demonstrated my expertise in implementing SVM linear algorithms and my ability to solve real-world problems using machine learning techniques. The project includes a detailed explanation of the dataset used, the preprocessing steps taken, and the implementation of the SVM linear algorithm.

I hope that this project will be helpful for anyone looking to gain insights into multiclass classification problems and SVM linear algorithms. Feel free to explore the project and provide your valuable feedback.# Animals-classification-multiclass
